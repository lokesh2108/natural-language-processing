This repository contains my journey through NLP, where I have implemented and experimenting with various NLP models and techniques. My goal is to strengthen my knowledge and skills in NLP while sharing my learning process with others.

Here are the main topics I will be covering in the Jupyter Notebooks:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, Lemmatization, Stopword Removal
- **Word Embeddings**: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText
- **Language Models**: BERT, GPT, Transformer models
- **Text Classification**: Sentiment Analysis, Spam Detection
- **Sequence Models**: RNN, LSTM, GRU
- **Text Generation**: Markov Chains, LSTM for text generation
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: SpaCy, Transformers-based NER

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NLTK, SpaCy, Transformers (Hugging Face), TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lokesh2108/natural-language-processing.git
